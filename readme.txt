Lab Assignment 5

The makefile should be properly configured, so simply typing "make" from the program directory should build the program.
The program builds as "dict"

I know it wasn't required in the assignment, but the fact that words like you're would return as two words ("you" and "re") bothered me so I set it to treat the appostrophe as a valid character.
